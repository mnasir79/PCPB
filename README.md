**Warning: Beta release. See open issues [here](https://bitbucket.org/eccemea/analytics-hub/issues?status=new&status=open)**
* * *

An easy to deploy and configure hub between PureCloud, CIC and dashboard applications and allow you to create dashboards without any development knowledge. This Chrome Extension pushes data from [PureCloud](https://www.inin.com/solutions/purecloud-platform) and/or [CIC](https://www.inin.com/customer-engagement/call-center-software) to [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/tour/).

How to create your own copy:
----------------------------

**You do not need to follow this if you only want to install the extension**
* * *
**To install the extension, please go [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inin-analytics-hub/ojgodpdmapceodglkfkbkmddkeibibmd)**
* * *

* Requirements
    * PowerBI account: sign up [here](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web). Microsoft account required.
    * If you want to show PureCloud stats, you will need your own [PureCloud org](https://mypurecloud.com)
    * If you want to show CIC stats, a recent version (4.0 SU6+) of CIC


* Before installing the chrome extension, you need to configure a few things:
    * CIC (optional, only if you want to gather stats about CIC workgroups in PowerBI)
        * Create a dedicated admin user on your CIC server that will be used to query workgroup statistics
        * An ICWS license is required (same as IceLib)
    * PureCloud (optional, only if you want to gather stats about PureCloud queues in PowerBI)
        * Get your own PureCloud org [here](http://mypurecloud.com/)
        * Create a custom OAuth application in the PureCloud admin module by going to Admin/Integrations and select the oAuth option. [Learn more](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/authorization/create-oauth-client-id.html). Make sure you add the "Developer" role to your user otherwise you will not see any OAuth option under Admin\Integrations.
        * Use the following settings:

![oauth.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/6pxRex/images/3582494050-oauth.jpg)
        * Copy the Client Id and Client Secret. You will need them later on.

    * Go to the app page: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inin-analytics-hub/ojgodpdmapceodglkfkbkmddkeibibmd
    * Click on "Add To Chrome"

* Timer: Same as the PureCloud timer. Used to indicate the duration between 2 polls. Depending on the number of groups you have in PureCloud, having a value of less than 5000 (5 seconds) can cause high-CPU usage. A value of 10000 (10 seconds) is recommended.
* Optimize Output: If checked, only changes are pushed to PowerBI instead of the whole dataset.
